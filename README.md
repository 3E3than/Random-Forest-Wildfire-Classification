Wildfire Prediction using Earth Engine and Random Forest

This project integrates Google Earth Engine and machine learning to analyze and predict wildfire occurrences. It processes remote sensing data, extracts key environmental indicators, and trains an optimized Random Forest model for classification.
The initial dataset and data processing approaches were derived from Predictive modeling of wildfires: A new dataset and machine learning approach created by Hajar Mousannif and Hassan Al Moatassime.
